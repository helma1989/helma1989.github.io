    <h1>Interests and passions</h1>
    <p>Languages are my passion, I speak Spanish, English, Italian, a little bit of German and Catalan.</p>
    <p>>I also enjoy reading books of the most varied genres: science-fiction, horror, novels, every book has something to teach us and I love discovering them all.</p>
    <p>Last but not least I love to paint using watercolors, although I don't do it as much as I would like. When I paint I feel free and powerful, as if the world was in my hands. I think there is something magical about depicting the world using my hands.</p>
